The dataset used in this code is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset. This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks in machine learning, specifically for predicting whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on various features. Here's a description of the dataset:

Number of Instances: The dataset contains a total of 569 instances.

Number of Features: Each instance has 30 numeric features, representing various characteristics of cell nuclei computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Target Variable: The target variable is the diagnosis, which is categorized into two classes:

Malignant (denoted by 'M'): Indicates that the tumor is cancerous.
Benign (denoted by 'B'): Indicates that the tumor is not cancerous.
Data Attributes:

ID: Unique identifier for each instance.
Diagnosis: The target variable indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
Features: Numerical values representing various characteristics of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, fractal dimension, etc.
Data Quality: The dataset is considered high-quality, as it has been preprocessed and cleaned. However, it's always a good practice to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check for any missing values or inconsistencies in the data.
