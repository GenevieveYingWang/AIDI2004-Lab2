This code snippet loads a dataset containing diagnostic information, preprocesses it, trains two machine learning models (logistic regression and decision tree) to predict diagnosis, evaluates their performance, and visualizes the feature importances for the logistic regression model. Finally, it saves both trained models for future use.
